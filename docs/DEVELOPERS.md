# ESTA Developers Guide

ESTA is a Python-based modeling system. As such, it is designed as a stand-alone program inside a working environment, and not as an installable Python library.

> TODO: This guide is incomplete.

When complete, this guide should cover:

* The basic architecture/code structure of ESTA.
* A rigorous understanding of the design goals.
* The primary algorithms that are important to performance.
  * Sparse-Matrix Design: Because many sub-areas will be involved in a larger modeling domain (grid)
  * KD Trees Algorithm: Efficient intersection of links onto projected modeling domain
