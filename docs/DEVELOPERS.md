# ESTA Developers Guide

ESTA is a Python-based modeling system. As such, it is designed as a stand-alone program inside a working environment, and not as an installable Python library.

> TODO: This guide is incomplete.

## Design Goals

Modularity is the primary design goal for ESTA. Applying spatial surrogates and gridding an inventory is not, generally a hard problem. The problems are generally: (1) file wrangling, and (2) the need for continuous updating to meet the latest scientific requirements.

## Important Algorithms

TODO

* Sparse-Matrix Design: Because many sub-areas will be involved in a larger modeling domain (grid)
* KD Trees Algorithm: Efficient intersection of links onto projected modeling domain
