# ESTA Installation Guide

ESTA was designed to run under Python 2.6 or 2.7 in Linux. Though it may work in Python 3.x under Windows or Mac, those are non-tested and should be considered unsupported.

## Requirements

Four non-standard, but common, Python libraries need be installed if you wish to run every tool in ESTA.

* NumPy
* pandas
* pyproj
* SciPy
